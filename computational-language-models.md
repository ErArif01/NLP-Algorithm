Computational language models are a class of artificial intelligence models that use computational methods, often based on machine learning, to understand and generate human language.
These models have gained significant attention and advancements in recent years, transforming the field of natural language processing(NLP). 
One of the most notable types of computational language models is the transformer-based model.
